<br>You can switch any version of your wish as i patched them.
<br>You can downgrade BIOS with this.
<br>I'm not accepting any responsibility but i tested them in AN515-45-r0se
<br>So they should work on any Nitro 5 AN515-45
<br>Pick a version then stick with it.
<br>Don't constantly change BIOS version since you are asking for bricking your computer.
<br>First version of BIOS is always superior for me because it will went in more testing during development.
